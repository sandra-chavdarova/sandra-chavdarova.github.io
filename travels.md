One of the most memorable places I have traveled to is Vienna, the capital of Austria. I went there at the end of 2022 on a trip from high school. I was mesmerized by the cathedral and luckily I got to take a photo of it as the sun was setting and the colors are breathtaking.

And one of the most recent places I have been to is Egypt, specifically Luxor. Despite the very high temperatures, I enjoyed every moment of it.
