My name is Sandra Chavdarova. I have always been interested in mathematics and programming, that has lead to attending The Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, majoring in Software Engineering and Information Systems.

Outside of my professional interests, I enjoy diving into various hobbies. I enjoy reading books and love listening to music. When I'm not studying or reading, you can find me outdoors, jogging or taking walks, capturing moments through my phone camera.
